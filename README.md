# AIZO Project

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the "Algorithms and Computational Complexity" course at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. It features implementations of three fundamental sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Bubble Sort.

## Features
- **Three Sorting Algorithms**: Includes implementation of Insertion, Merge, and Bubble sort.
- **Random Number Generation**: Facilitates the generation of random numbers to test the sorting algorithms.
- **Performance Measurement**: Measures and compares the execution time of each sorting algorithm.
- **Data Handling**: Capability to load data from a file and display numbers before and after sorting.


## Installation
Provide step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run the project locally. For example:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aizo_project.git
cd aizo_project
# add any additional commands needed for setup
